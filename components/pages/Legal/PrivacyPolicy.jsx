            The Advertising Club Madras respects your privacy and recognizes the
            need to protect the personally identifiable information (any
            information by which you can be identified, such as name, address,
            e-mail, telephone number and any other personal information) you
            share with us. We would like to assure you that we follow
            appropriate standards when it comes to protecting your privacy on our

            In general, you can visit adclubmadras.com without telling us who you
            are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track
            the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and
            analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user
            remains anonymous.

            Some of our web pages use “cookies” so that we can better serve you
            with customized information when you return to our site. Cookies are
            identifiers which a website can send to your browser to keep on your
            computer to facilitate your next visit to our site. You can set your

            There are times when we may collect personal information from you
            such as name, physical address or telephone number. It is our intent
            to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do
            with the information. Generally, if you have concern in providing
            certain personal information, then you may contact Advertising Club
            Madras & raise your concern so that we will try to give you an option
            of not to provide certain information, and in the future you will be
            able to “opt out” of certain uses of the information. If you choose
            not to provide the information we request, you can still visit
            Advertising Club Madras but you may be unable to access certain
            options, offers and services.
